                     the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! i enrolled shortly therafter. The next 12
                     weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've 
                     successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

                    recommended!</h4>

                 <p>* Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionalswho can help me learn programming
                    step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
                    about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
                    and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took
                    my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during
                    interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
                    offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
